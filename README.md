## E-commerce Computer Parts Project 
 The goal of this class project was to use software engineering practices to make a E-commerce platfrom for computer builds and parts that caters to different types of users. We were given [project specifications](#ProjectSpecfifcations) which served as a guideline for what the website needed to have. We created two [ software requirements specification
 ](#SoftwareRequirementsSpecificationDocuments)documents which showcases how we used UML models to plan different components of our website, from use cases to data base and enitity relationships.
